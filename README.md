## Setup

Same way you would install a typical laravel application.

    composer install

    npm install

    php artisan db:seed

    php artisan serve

The UI is displayed on the root page

*Note: The hmos and providers table must be seeded before proceeding*

Don't forget to run `npm run dev` after modifying the vue component.
